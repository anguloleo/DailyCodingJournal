Learned about Promises. The shear amount of material feels like a 
weeks worth or learning. It might juts be bloat and I may have
better luck understaning by googling it then by App academys
materail. We only have 1 day to learn so thats interesting.

I started working at my sisters office 3 days a week to pay my bills.
I worked today and spend the rest of my day going through the material for the day.
This week I will try something different where I spend most of my time doing the 
practice problems and go through the content as I complete the problem.
there is not enough time to do everything so I am focusing on the practices more.
Hopefully that will help me more. 

1/14/25
I spend the day working on the reading and the practice. i've been going at it non stop and am almost done with everything.
I work tomorrow so I'll have to do what I can after work and catch up the day after. I need to work on skimming on the reading as this may be the only way i may be able to keep up.
This is incredibly time consuming. Again I dont know how everyone else is doing it. 

1/15/25
